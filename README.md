# Entropy
A bouns project for Random Variables and Stochastic Processes class (ECE 515). 

Entropies were calculated using four different languages: English, Spanish, French and Italian. A text file is loaded in to MATLAB and then converted it to characters that are easy to handle and process on MATLAB. The total characters were counted by excluding any character that is not a letter. The algorithm capitalizes the entire letters and creates case-insensitive. The probability found by counting the number of each letter exists in the text and divide it by the total letters. Entropy, then, is calculated using For-loop to include the probability of each letter.
